By: `Team T09-B2`      Since: `Mar 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `CalendarPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelComponentCollegeZone.PNG[width="1100"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageComponentCollegeZone.PNG[width="900"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

.Structure of Logic Command
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

.Initial UndoRedoStack
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

.UndoRedoStack given new command input
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

.Undo command on UndoRedoStack
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Sequence diagram for `undo`
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.UndoRedoStack given command `clear`
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.UndoRedoStack given command `list`
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

.Activity diagram of UndoRedoStack
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire CollegeZone.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the CollegeZone (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::logging[]
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

// end::logging[]

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Enhanced Find Command [Since v1.1]

The old find command feature only allows searching by name. To make CollegeZone more useful for RC4 students, we have enhanced the find
command feature to be able to find persons by tags.

==== Aspect: User Input
* Old user input format: find <name>
* New user input format: find n/<name> t/<tag>

==== Aspect: Nature of user input
* Searching of name and tag at the same time is not allowed
* If user is searching by name, user input should be: find n/<name> t/<empty>
* If user is searching by tags, user input should be: find n/<empty> t/<tag>

=== Logic: Command Aliases [Since v1.1]

CollegeZone users may now use shortcuts to perform desired tasks. These shortcuts are shown in figure 3.6.1.

//end::find[]

// tag::tagcolours[]
=== Enhanced tag colours [Since v1.1]
Tags are now colour-coded which allows improved differentiation between many different tags. Different coloured tags
also makes it more eye catching for users.
// end::tagcolours[]

// tag::addandedit[]
=== Targeted add and edit command [Since v1.2]
As CollegeZone is designed for NUS RC4 students to use, being able to record other students Level of Friendship,
 Birthday, RC4 Unit Number and RC4 CCAs, will be a useful feature for them.

As CollegeZone is catered toward NUS RC4 Residents, we have changed the attributes of a Person to hold: +
*Name, Mobile Number, Birthday, Level of Friendship, RC4 Unit Number, Meet up dates with RC4 students, RC4 CCAs and Tags*. +
This is done by removing unwanted attributes of a person and adding new attributes of a person.

.Class diagram for Student
image::RCPersonClass.JPG[width="450"]


==== Aspect: Nature of new Attributes
* Birthday: Must be a valid date.
* Level Of Friendship: Level of friendship is an integer from 1 to 10. The level is indicated by the number of hearts via the UI.
* Unit Number: Must be a valid unit number in RC4.
* Meet Date: Must be a valid date.
* A RC4 resident is able to have multiple CCAs.

==== Aspect: displaying Level Of Friendship
* Level of Friendship is displayed as a string of heart symbols. It is represented this way as it more intuitive for users to understand what the symbols mean.
// end::addandedit[]

// tag::reminder[]
=== Reminders [Since v1.4]

==== Introduction +

RC4 students will have a very busy schedule that consists of tasks, events & activities. +
Hence, we decided on implementing a reminder feature to allow them to add & delete reminders in CollegeZone to assist them in organising their schedule. +

The `AddReminderCommand` allows you to add a `Reminder` into CollegeZone and is stored in an ArrayList, `UniqueReminderList`, in `AddressBook`.
The `DeleteReminderCommand` allows you to delete a `Reminder` from CollegeZone.

Reminder commands are undoable and redoable for the benefit users to redo and undo a command they did or did not intend to change. +
Hence, both `AddReminderCommand` and `DeleteReminderCommand` are implemented as `UndoableCommand`.

*Reminder Features:* +

* Adding a reminder to the Calendar: The `AddReminderCommand` allows you to add a `Reminder` into CollegeZone and is stored in an ArrayList, `UniqueReminderList`, in `AddressBook`.
* Deleting a reminder on the Calendar: The `DeleteReminderCommand` allows you to delete a `Reminder` from `UniqueReminderList`, in `AddressBook`.

Reminder commands are undoable and redoable for the benefit users to redo and undo a command they did or did not intend to change.
Hence, both `AddReminderCommand` and `DeleteReminderCommand` are implemented as `UndoableCommand`.

==== Implementation +

*Reminder Object* +

Every time a `Reminder` is created, three other objects are also created: +

1. `ReminderText`: This object contains a single string variable, `reminderText`, that is verified to contain characters and spaces and cannot be blank.  +
2. `DateTime`: This object contains a single string variable, `dateTime`. After obtaining the start date time from user input, it will parse through `nattyDateAndTimeParser` to convert it to a `LocalDateTime`
variable. Subsequently, this `LocalDateTime` variable will then be converted back to a string variable using `properReminderDateTimeFormat` and it stored as `dateTime` in `DateTime` object. +
3. `EndDateTime`: This object contains a single string variable, `dateTime`. After obtaining the end date time from user input, it will parse through `nattyDateAndTimeParser` to convert it to a `LocalDateTime`
                  variable. Subsequently, this `LocalDateTime` variable will then be converted back to a string variable using `properReminderDateTimeFormat` and it stored as `dateTime` in `DateTime` object.

A `Reminder` will be marked with a *blue* circle if it's not due and be marked with a *red* circle if it's due. +

Users can delete reminders on the Calendar if its already due or when they accidentally made a mistake. +

*UniqueReminderList* +

`UniqueReminderList` functions as a List of `Reminders` where every element is unique and is defined by its `ReminderText`,
`DateTime` and `EndDateTime`.

*Adding a Reminder* +

When `AddReminderCommand` is executed, it first checks whether there are any duplicate reminders in `UniqueReminderList`. If there is no duplicate reminder,
`Reminder` is added into `UniqueReminderList` in `AddressBook`.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `+r text/eat pills d/tmr 8pm e/tmr 10pm` Command
image::addReminderSeqDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Deleting a Reminder* +

When `DeleteReminderCommand` is executed, it will find the `Reminder` specified by the user using parameters `ReminderText` and `DateTime`. If `Reminder` specified by user
is not found in `UniqueReminderList`, `CommandException` will be thrown. If `Reminder` is found, it will then be removed from `UniqueReminderList`. The code snippet to find and remove the `Reminder`
specified by user is shown below.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `-r text/eat pills d/tmr 8pm` Command
image::delReminderSeqDiagram.png[width="800"]

[source,java]
----
@Override
    protected void preprocessUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        model.updateFilteredReminderList(predicate);
        List<Reminder> lastShownList = model.getFilteredReminderList();
        targetIndex = Index.fromOneBased(1);
        if (lastShownList.size() > 1) {
            for (Reminder reminder : lastShownList) {
                if (reminder.getDateTime().toString().equals(dateTime)) {
                    reminderToDelete = reminder;
                }
            }
        } else {
            if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
                throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_REMINDER_TEXT_DATE);
            }

            reminderToDelete = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());
        }
    }
----

*Syncing Reminder to Calendar* +

To display the reminder in the calendar, we have a `CalendarPanel` that takes in the `UniqueReminderList`.

[source,java]
----
    public CalendarPanel(ObservableList<Reminder> reminderList, ObservableList<Person> personList) {
        super(FXML);

        this.reminderList = reminderList;
        this.personList = personList;

        calendarView = new CalendarView();
        setupCalendar();
        updateCalendar();
        registerAsAnEventHandler(this);
    }
----
`UniqueReminderList` will then be iterated and each reminder in the list is individually added into the calendar through `updateCalendar()`. Every time a new reminder is added into `CollegeZone`, an event handler, `handleNewCalendarEvent`, will
cause `calendarUpdate()` to run again and `CalendarPanel` will be updated to display the new reminder added onto `CollegeZone`.

[source,java]
----
    @Subscribe
    private void handleNewCalendarEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent event) {
        reminderList = event.data.getReminderList();
        personList = event.data.getPersonList();
        Platform.runLater(this::updateCalendar);
    }

    /**
     * Updates the Calendar with Reminders that are already added
     */
    private void updateCalendar() {
        setDateAndTime();
        CalendarSource myCalendarSource = new CalendarSource("Reminders and Meetups");
        Calendar calendarRDue = new Calendar("Reminders Already Due");
        Calendar calendarRNotDue = new Calendar("Reminders Not Due");
        Calendar calendarM = new Calendar("Meetups");
        calendarRDue.setStyle(Calendar.Style.getStyle(4));
        calendarRDue.setLookAheadDuration(Duration.ofDays(365));
        calendarRNotDue.setStyle(Calendar.Style.getStyle(1));
        calendarRNotDue.setLookAheadDuration(Duration.ofDays(365));
        calendarM.setStyle(Calendar.Style.getStyle(3));
        myCalendarSource.getCalendars().add(calendarRDue);
        myCalendarSource.getCalendars().add(calendarRNotDue);
        myCalendarSource.getCalendars().add(calendarM);
        for (Reminder reminder : reminderList) {
            LocalDateTime ldtstart = nattyDateAndTimeParser(reminder.getDateTime().toString()).get();
            LocalDateTime ldtend = nattyDateAndTimeParser(reminder.getEndDateTime().toString()).get();
            LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
            if (now.isBefore(ldtend)) {
                calendarRNotDue.addEntry(new Entry(
                        reminder.getReminderText().toString(), new Interval(ldtstart, ldtend)));
            } else {
                calendarRDue.addEntry(new Entry(reminder.getReminderText().toString(), new Interval(ldtstart, ldtend)));
            }
        }
        //@@author sham-sheer
        for (Person person : personList) {
            String meetDate = person.getMeetDate().toString();
            if (!meetDate.isEmpty()) {
                int day = Integer.parseInt(meetDate.substring(0,
                        2));
                int month = Integer.parseInt(meetDate.substring(3,
                        5));
                int year = Integer.parseInt(meetDate.substring(6,
                        10));
                calendarM.addEntry(new Entry("Meeting " + person.getName().toString(),
                        new Interval(LocalDate.of(year, month, day), LocalTime.of(12, 0),
                                LocalDate.of(year, month, day), LocalTime.of(13, 0))));
            }
        }
        calendarView.getCalendarSources().add(myCalendarSource);
    }
----

When a reminder is deleted, it will go through the same process as adding reminder and the changes will then be updated in the calendar.

==== Design Considerations

*Aspect*: Deleting a `Reminder` from `CollegeZone`.

*Alternative 1*: Delete `Reminder` using an index which is the index of the particular `Reminder` in `UniqueReminderList` +
*Pros*: Implementing `DeleteReminderCommand` by parsing an index will be simple as `DeleteCommand` to delete a person from `AddressBook` is using a similar implementation. +
*Cons*: We will have to first implement a list function to list all reminders with their respective indexes, which may be undesirable as there may be
a large number of reminders to be listed out. This will in turn require the need of a find function to find a specific reminder that the users want to delete.

*Alternative 2(current choice)*: Delete `Reminder` identified by `ReminderText` and `DateTime`. +
*Pros*: Reduces the need of a listing and finding function to delete a `Reminder` from `CollegeZone`. +
*Cons*: Implementation of `DeleteReminderCommand` will be more difficult as we will have to integrate a find function to pick out
the specific `Reminder` that the user wants to remove.

=== Goals
==== Introduction
CollegeZone is designed for RC4 students to use. RC4 students often have goals that they want to achieve in life
– Career goals, health goals, social goals, relationship goals etc. This additional goal feature is created for RC4 users to add and keep track of their goals throughout their stay.
The main reason behind this implementation is because setting goals gives you *long-term vision* and *short-term motivation* for the goals.
This implementation allows RC4 students to set goals in _CollegeZone_ – big or small ones - so
 that they will be reminded of the goals that they have set for themselves.

*Goal features:*
```
 1. add goal
 2. edit goal
 3. delete goal
 4. complete goal
 5. ongoing goal
 6. sort goal
```
==== Implementation of Goal Object

*Goal objects consists of 5 attributes :* +

1. Date and time of when goal is completed. +
2. Level of importance of goal. +
3. Text content of Goal. +
4. Date and time of Goal of when goal has started. +
5. Goal completion status.

._Class diagram of Goal_

The code snippet shown below shows the overloading of StartDateTime constructor class.
It keeps both a String value and a LocalDateTime value.
The _Code-snippet 2 and 3_ shows the conversion of the String value to LocalDateTime value and vice versa.

.Code-snippet 1
[source,java]
----
public class StartDateTime implements Comparable<StartDateTime> {

    public final String value;
    public final LocalDateTime localDateTimeValue;

    public StartDateTime(LocalDateTime startDateTime) {
        requireNonNull(startDateTime);
        this.localDateTimeValue = startDateTime;
        this.value = properDateTimeFormat(startDateTime);
    }

    public StartDateTime(String startDateTimeInString) {
        requireNonNull(startDateTimeInString);
        this.value = startDateTimeInString;
        this.localDateTimeValue = getLocalDateTimeFromProperDateTime(startDateTimeInString);
    }
}
----

.Code-snippet 2
[source,java]
----
    public static String properDateTimeFormat(LocalDateTime dateTime) {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        int day = dateTime.getDayOfMonth();
        String month = dateTime.getMonth().getDisplayName(TextStyle.FULL, Locale.ENGLISH);
        int year = dateTime.getYear();
        int hour = dateTime.getHour();
        int minute = dateTime.getMinute();
        builder.append("Date: ")
                .append(day)
                .append(" ")
                .append(month)
                .append(" ")
                .append(year)
                .append(",  Time: ")
                .append(String.format("%02d", hour))
                .append(":")
                .append(String.format("%02d", minute));
        return builder.toString();
    }
----

.Code-snippet 3
[source,java]
----
    public static LocalDateTime getLocalDateTimeFromProperDateTime(String properDateTimeString) {
        String trimmedArgs = properDateTimeString.trim();
        int size = trimmedArgs.length();
        String stringFormat = properDateTimeString.substring(BEGIN_INDEX, size);
        stringFormat = stringFormat.replace(", Time: ", "");
        return nattyDateAndTimeParser(stringFormat).get();
    }
----

==== Implementation of add goal

Adding a goal into _CollegeZone_ is facilitated by `AddGoalCommand`, which extends `UndoableCommand`, it
supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the _CollegeZone_.

[source,java]
----
public class AddGoalCommand extends UndoableCommand {
@Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        // ... AddGoalCommand logic ...
    }
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows the flow of operation from the point _CollegeZone_ receives an input to the output of the result.

._Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `+g` Command_
image::AddGoalSeqDiagram.PNG[width="800"]


AddGoalCommand is implemented in this way:

In the Logic componenet, `AddressBookParser` will parse the user's input and detects if add goal keyword contains correct parsing keywords after.
For example, e.g. +g text/eat healthily impt/9
* AddGoalCommandParser: (More about this method will be mentioned later)
** Parses the input by extracting the input text and importance +
*** Parsed text : eat healthily +
*** Parsed importance : 9
** Creates a AddGoalCommand class and passes the text and importance and string as arguments
* AddGoalCommand:
** Adds the new goal to the list locally
** Runs the execution which calls the model

2. Model

* Calls the model and gets the goals list
* Adds the new goal into the goals list

3. Ui
* Displays the new goal added in the goal list panel

4. Storage
* Stores the new goal added in the address book storage

Note:

- All goals will have a string of stars (indicating importance) in a yellow border directly below the goal text in the goal list panel.
- Goal that are just added will be placed at the bottom of the goal list. +

The `AddGoalCommandParser` returns `AddGoalCommand` after execution, which will be further processed by `logic` component.

AddGoalCommandParser is implemented in this way:
[source,java]
----
public class AddGoalCommandParser implements Parser<AddGoalCommand> {

    public static final String EMPTY_END_DATE_TIME = "";
    public static final boolean INITIAL_COMPLETION_STATUS = false;

    public AddGoalCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        ArgumentMultimap argMultimap =
                ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_IMPORTANCE, PREFIX_GOAL_TEXT);

        if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_IMPORTANCE, PREFIX_GOAL_TEXT)
                || !argMultimap.getPreamble().isEmpty()) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, AddGoalCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
        try {
            Importance importance = ParserUtil.parseImportance(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_IMPORTANCE)).get();
            GoalText goalText = ParserUtil.parseGoalText(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_GOAL_TEXT)).get();
            StartDateTime startDateTime = new StartDateTime(LocalDateTime.now());
            EndDateTime endDateTime = new EndDateTime(EMPTY_END_DATE_TIME);
            Completion completion = new Completion(INITIAL_COMPLETION_STATUS);
            Goal goal = new Goal(importance, goalText, startDateTime, endDateTime, completion);
            return new AddGoalCommand(goal);
        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            throw new ParseException(ive.getMessage(), ive);
        }
    }
----

Notice that everytime a goal is added, the start date time of the goal will be recorded down in real time and it's completion
status will be "ongoing" by default.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of adding start date time and completion status of goal +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Having the current date time as the start date time and having a default completion status of a goal added. +
**Pros:** User have lesser words to input in the command box. +
**Cons:** User might have a preferred start date time and completion status of the goal that they just added. +
**Alternative 2:** Giving user a choice of start date time input and completion status of goal added. +
**Pros:** Allows user to choose their own start date time and completion status. +
**Cons:** Tedious for user to input a longer add goal command and slightly more difficult to properly parse the start date time
 that user enters.

---

**Aspect:** Representation of Goals level of importance in UI +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each level of importance have a number of stars related to it. +
**Pros:** Ability for the user to differentiate the Goals with higher level of importance compared to those with lower level of importance. +
**Cons:** The goal list in the UI might look messy to the user without having a sort Goals option as the list of goals is displayed based on when it was added. +
**Alternative 2:** Having an additional sort goal command +
**Pros:** It is simple and easy to understand. +
**Cons:** It requires extra methods to implement the sort function. +

---

**Aspect:** Representation of Goals in UI +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Having a goal list panel beside our current person list panel. +
**Pros:** Ability for the user to differentiate the Goals with higher level of importance compared to those with lower level of importance. +
**Cons:** The initial space in UI reserved for person list is not being used to display 2 lists, the person list and the goal list. This causes the UI to look clunky and overwhelming. +
**Alternative 2:** Having a tab button in CollegeZone that allows user to switch between the person list panel and goal list panel. +
**Pros:** Ability for user to switch to person list and goal list in the UI, which makes it look more user friendly. +
**Cons:** As CollegeZone is a desktop application that has most interactions happen using a Command Line Interface (CLI), a new command to switch tabs between goal list and person list needs to be implemented. +

==== Implementation of delete goal


All goal commands are event driven. +
The following is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("goal remove 1")` API call. +

image::GoalHighLevelSequenceDiagram.jpg[width="800"]
    Figure 3.10.0.1: Goal delete Sequence Diagram

1. Logic
* AddressBookParser: Detects if goal delete keyword contains correct parsing keyword after +
e.g. deletegoal 1
* DeleteGoalCommandParser:
** Parses the input by extracting the input index +
*** Parsed index : 1 +
** Creates a DeleteGoalCommand class and passes the index as argument
* DeleteGoalCommand:
** Deletes the goal corresponding to the index locally
** Runs the execution which calls the model

2. Model

* 1. Calls the model and gets the filtered goals list
* 2. Deletes the deleted Goal object
* 3. Updates the filtered goals list
* 4. Gets the updated filtered goals list

3. Ui
* Displays the deletion of goal in the goal list panel

4. Storage
* Deletes the details of the deleted goal in the address book storage

*Reason for how it is implemented* +

* Makes use of existing implementations +
Coming up with new algorithms is very time consuming. Implementation of My Goals Page uses new implementations
are very similar to how CollegeZone implements its contacts. This is implemented in this way so as to reduce errors and complexity in the code. +


==== Design Considerations


---
// end::myGoalsPage[]


==== Implementation of sort goal

The sorting goal mechanism is facilitated by `SortGoalCommandParser` and `SortGoalCommand`, with both classes residing
in the `Logic` component of CollegeZone. `SortGoalCommand` in not undoable.

`SortGoalCommandParser` takes in an arguments in the form of `FIELD` and `ORDER` that defines how `UniqueGoalList`
should be sorted. You may customise the sort goal operation, with `FIELD` specifying the goal field to sort and `ORDER`
specifying the type of sort order. It checks for validity against a few keywords. For example, `ORDER` only accepts 2 keywords: `ascending` or `descending`.
On the other hand, `FIELD` only accepts 3 keywords: `importance`, `startdatetime` and `completion`.
 Once verified, the argument will be tokenized to identify your specified sort type. A `SortGoalCommand` object is then
  created with the identified sort type.

Upon execution of `SortGoalCommand`, a `Comparator<Goal>` will be initialised based on the sort type it receives.
A `sortPersons` function call will be made to `Model`, which propagates down to `UniqueGoalList`, where the sorting of the `internalList` occurs.

=== Theme Enhancement
CollegeZone has multiple themes for the user to choose from. Currently, there are 3 themes implemented.
Namely, `dark` theme, `bubblegum` theme and `light` theme. This command is not undoable.

ThemeCommand is

// tag::meetCommand[]
=== Meet Command [Since v1.2]

The new meet up command was implemented specifically to provide a platform in CollegeZone for RC4 students to set up
meeting with other students with ease.
// end::meetCommand[]

//tag::sortmech[]
=== Sorting mechanism

The sorting mechanism is facilitated by `SortCommandParser` and `SortCommand`, with both classes residing in the `Logic` component of the address book. Since the address book state will be modified during the sorting process, the `sort` has to be undoable.

`SortCommandParser` takes in an argument in the form of `INDEX_TYPE` that defines how `UniquePersonList` should be sorted. You may customise the sort operation, with `PREFIX` specifying the sort type. It first checks for validity against a regular expression. Once verified, the argument will be tokenized to identify your specified sort type. A `SortCommand` object is then created with the identified sort type.

The `INDEX_TYPE` can be any three of the following: `1` for sorting RC4 Students based on their level of friendship, `2` for sorting persons by meet date, `3` for sorting persons by Birthday. The `ORDER` can be either `asc` for sorting in ascending order or `dsc` for sorting in descending order. The sorted list is always default to descending order of importance.

Upon execution of `SortCommand`, a `Comparator<Person>` will be initialised based on the sort type it receives. A `sortPersons` function call will be made to `Model`, which propagates down to `UniquePersonList`, where the sorting of the `internalList` occurs. Since sorting of `internalList` results in the change of state to address book, `SortCommand` is to be implemented as an `UndoableCommand`.


[NOTE]
Implementation of Sorting Mechanism requires both the manipulation of `Logic` and `Model` component of address book.

The following sequence diagram shows the flow of operation from the point the address book receives an input to the output of the result.

image::SortPersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.2 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `sort 1` Command_

[NOTE]
If the list is found to be empty, an `CommandException` will be thrown from `SortCommand`. The command should be terminated without any state change, keeping the redoStack clean of changes.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Initialising of `Comparator<Person>` +
**Alternative 1:** Initialise in `SortCommand` +
**Pros:** Clear separation of concerns, `SortCommandParser` to handle identifying of attribute to sort by only. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to follow as other commands like `AddCommand` handles object creation in its parser. +
**Alternative 2 (current choice): ** Initialise in `UniquePersonList` +
**Pros:** Straightforward as initialises the `Comparator` where it is used. +
**Cons:** `UniquePersonList` is at a lower level and should only handle a minimal set of `Person` related operations, and not logical operations like string matching. +

---

**Aspect:** Sorting by multiple attribute +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allows sorting by single attribute +
**Pros:** Fast and arguments to input is straightforward. +
**Cons:** Unable to have fine grain control of how list should appear. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow sorting by multiple attribute +
**Pros:** Enables fine grain control of how list should appear. +
**Cons:** Not necessary as effect is only obvious when contact list is long and has multiple common names. As target audience for iConnect are students, contact list will not be more than few thousand contacts long. +
// end::sortmech[]


// tag::rate[]
=== Rate friends [Since v1.4]
The Rate friends feature allows RC4 residents to rate their friends and change their levels of friendship.
This feature is implemented by the `RateCommand` and `RateCommandParser` in the Logic component of the CollegeZone code.
The RC4 student is able to rate one or more friends by keying in the new desired level of friendship through the Command Line Interface (CLI).
The `RateCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommands` as well, as shown in the diagram below.

image::RateCommandClassDiagram.jpg[width="400"]

To rate other RC4 residents and friends, the `LevelOfFriendship` class is being used and is part of the `Person` class.
A `Person` is composed of a `LevelOfFriendship` component, and each person in CollegeZone application has a particular level of friendship between `1` to `10`.
The next diagram illustrates the relationship between a
`Person` and its `LevelOfFriendship`.

image::RCPersonClass.jpg[width="400"]

The following shows a part of the code of `RateCommand` and reveals
the parameters that `RateCommand` makes use of.

[source,java]
    public RateCommand(List<Index> indexList, String levelOfFriendship) {
    }

As observed, `RateCommand` involves two parameters, namely `indexList` and `leveloffriendship`.

`indexList` has a `List` of indexes type, and `leveloffriendship` is of `String` type.

The parameter `indexList` refers to the list of students whose are intended to be rated, and thus
`RateCommand` is able to help RC4 residents rate multiple people at a time. The `leveloffriendship`
parameter refers to the new level of friendship that the resident would like to rate their friends to.

The following code sample shows the execution of `RateCommnad`,
[source,java]
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        List<Person> latestList = model.getFilteredPersonList();
        for (Index index : indexList) {
            Person selectedPerson = latestList.get(index.getZeroBased());
            try {
                Person editedPerson = new Person(selectedPerson.getName(), selectedPerson.getPhone(),
                        selectedPerson.getBirthday(), new LevelOfFriendship(levelOfFriendship),
                        selectedPerson.getUnitNumber(),
                        selectedPerson.getCcas(), selectedPerson.getMeetDate(), selectedPerson.getTags());
                model.updatePerson(selectedPerson, editedPerson);

As seen, the index of the student whose level of friendship is to be rated and changed, a new `editedPerson` object is created
and all the details of the person, the name and phone number and other details were copied from the `selectedPerson` and is assigned the new level of friendship from the rate command.


[NOTE]
If an invalid index value is entered, i.e the person with an `index` of which does not exist in CollegeZone contact list is entered with valid `index` entries,
only the valid entries will have their `Level of friendships` rated and updated.
As seen in the code below, there will be a error message informing the user that they have keyed in an invalid `index` value.

[source,java]
            if (index.getZeroBased() >= latestList.size()) {
                throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_ONE_OR_MORE_INVALID_INDEX);
            }


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `RateCommand`. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new `Person` object which copies all its respective personal details and adds a new `LevelOfFriendship` value. +
**Pros:** It uses a pre-existing method, and additional methods to implement `RateCommand` need not be created and added.  +
**Cons:** Copying all respective personal data in order to change only the `LevelOfFriendship` attribute can be excessive as cause additional processing time if a `person` have many attributes. +
**Alternative 2:** Add a `changeLevelOfFriendship` setter method in `Person` class +
**Pros:** Relatively simple to implement. +
**Cons:** Additional methods have to be added to ensure that the `input values` and `indexes` are valid.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, CollegeZone depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
